# Hotel-Sentimental-Analysis
Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning (RNN)

Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Sentiment Analysis on TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The model is trained to classify customer feedback as positive or negative, helping businesses gain insights into customer satisfaction.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and sequence padding.

Deep Learning Model: Implementation of an RNN-based model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Sentiment Classification: Predicts whether a hotel review is positive or negative.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset: Uses TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews dataset.

Technologies Used

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras

Deep Learning Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Data Processing: Tokenization, Text Vectorization

Dataset: TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews
Dataset Details

The dataset consists of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.

The reviews are labeled as positive or negative.

The dataset is preprocessed using tokenization and padding for RNN training.

Model Implementation

Text Tokenization: Uses Keras' Tokenizer to convert text into sequences.

Padding Sequences: Ensures uniform input size for RNN.

RNN Architecture:

Embedding Layer

LSTM/GRU for sequential text processing

Fully connected layers for classification

Usage
